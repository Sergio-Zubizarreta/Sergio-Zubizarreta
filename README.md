# 👋 Hi there!

I'm an aspiring **graphics programmer** and **technical artist** currently attending **Florida International University (FIU)** as a first-semester freshman, pursuing a **BSc in Computer Science**.

## 🎨 Interests & Inspiration

I’m passionate about using technology to create beauty—building memorable, deeply immersive worlds with signature graphics and rendering techniques. My personal hero and professional inspiration is **Inigo Quilez**: his legendary _ShaderToy_ and his chronicles in the Desmos scene have shaped my journey. I aspire to gain mastery over how computers work at a fundamental level and use that knowledge to create economical, powerful, and elegant code. Working close to the metal is a must for me as a future software engineer.

## 📚 Current Coursework

- Programming I with **Java**
- Programming I with **Python**
- **C for Embedded Systems**
- **Calculus II**

Outside of standard university courses:
- **Unreal Engine Fundamentals** certification
- **Intro to Tech Art** certificate (Viacheslav Makhynko, Udemy)
- Completing Stephen Ulibarri’s **Unreal Engine and C++** sequence for deep UE familiarity
- Currently taking Jesse Pitella’s **Unreal Engine Niagara and Motion** courses
- Learning **Blender** and **Houdini** to understand the game asset pipeline and identify tooling gaps I can fill as my skills grow.

To complement my game engine and C++ interests, I’m also taking a Shader-Learning course and working through the following textbooks:
- *Foundations of Game Engine Development* by Eric Lengyel
- *Fundamentals of Computer Graphics* by Marschner and Shirley
- *Real-Time Rendering* by Tomas Akenine-Möller and Eric Haines
- *Physically Based Rendering* by Matt Pharr and Wenzel Jakob

I also plan to dive into **OpenGL** and **Vulkan** as I progress through my freshman coursework, further strengthening my graphics programming foundation.

Hopefully, this sequence will better equip me to digest the SIGGRAPH papers that are, for now, a bit arcane for a freshman.

## 🚀 Current Projects

- **INIT Build Program @ FIU (VR):**  
  My team is developing a mixed-reality creature-battling RPG using QR code recognition with the Meta Quest 3 headset. Our system uses computer vision to detect physical QR code cards, dynamically spawning 3D creature prefabs spatially anchored to the real world.  
  - **Game Modes:**  
    - _Solo_: Tamagotchi-style creature care with natural hand-tracking  
    - _(Planned)_ Multiplayer 3D platforming racing experience

- **2.5D Pixel Art RPG (In Design):**  
  I'm prototyping a **Zelda-like/JRPG** hi-res pixel art game inspired by my favorites—_Sea of Stars_, _Owlboy_, and upcoming releases like _Alabaster Dawn_ and _Threads of Time_  by Radical Fish Riyo Studios.

## 👤 Personal Trivia

- Born in **Venezuela**, emigrated to the US.
- Videogames were my gateway to learning English as a native Spanish speaker. I owe much of my drive and learning to them.
- First-generation university student.
- I absolutely live and breathe RPGs, fantasy adventures, worldbuilding, and the technology that brings these to life. Mike Pondsmith, Lawrence Schick and JRR Tolkien are my worldbuilder pantheon.
- Outside of being a gamedev nerd, I’m also fascinated by **molecular biology** and **space science**.
